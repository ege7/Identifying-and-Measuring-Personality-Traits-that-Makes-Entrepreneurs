# Project
The aim of the project is to understand and analyze the specific personality traits that lead individuals to become entrepreneurs. The team conducted a literature review on personality traits and used the findings to develop a game in Python that tests whether an entrepreneur possesses these traits. The game becomes progressively challenging, testing players' ability to perform under pressure and make decisions. The results of the game are used to determine if an entrepreneur will be successful and if they possess the personality traits present in the literature review. The team also considered the role of trauma as a potential indicator of entrepreneurial success.
