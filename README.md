## Project
The research project "Identifying and Measuring Personality Traits that Makes Entrepreneurs" aimed to understand the personality traits that lead individuals to become entrepreneurs. A literature review and a game were developed to test and measure these traits. The game tests players' ability to perform under pressure and make decisions, and the results are used to determine an entrepreneur's likelihood of success. The team also studied the potential role of trauma as an indicator of entrepreneurial success.
